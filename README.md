# CA2019-FP2
Base Code for Final Project Part-2

# Compile using:
nvcc FMIndex.cu -o FMIndex

# Run using:
./FMIndex small.txt

# Note:
You can currently use small.txt as input file, but this can change during tests.
Length of each read will be fixed to 64 for tests also, so you can customize your CUDA kernels and shared memory according to it.
